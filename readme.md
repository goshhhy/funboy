# funboy

this is a gameboy emulator which currently only emulates the original gameboy.

it is designed to be relatively simple while also making efficient use of cpu time,
allowing it to run on low-end processors - think low double digit MHz.

this emulator is imperfect. the cpu and timing emulation is relatively accurate, but
the ppu emulation needs much work, and sound emulation is currently missing entirely.
